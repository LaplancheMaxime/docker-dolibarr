# First use

When you first access your Dolibarr, you need to access the install wizard at `http://localhost/install/`.
The setup wizard will appear and ask you to choose an administrator account, password and the database connection. For the database use the name of your database container as host and `dolibarr` as table and user name. Also enter the database password you chose in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Most of the fields of the wizard can be initialized with the environment variables.

You should note though that some environment variables will be ignored during install wizard (`DOLI_AUTH` and `DOLI_LDAP_*` for instance). An initial `conf.php` was generated by the container on the first start with the Dolibarr environment variables you set through Docker. To use the container generated configuration, you can skip the first step of install and go directly to <http://localhost:8080/install/step2.php>.
